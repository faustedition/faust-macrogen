These utilities analyse and process the macrogenetic data XML files in the macrogenesis/ directory.

Directory Contents
==================

- ``dot-combine.sh`` is a shell script used to process Graphviz .dot files. It was called from the Java webapp
  but is probably obsolete and can be removed (TODO check)
- ``genetic_data_transcripts.py``
- ``inscription_order.py`` calculates a heuristic absolute temporal ordering of all inscriptions
- ``macrogenesis.py`` parses the macrogenesis XML files into a networkx graph
- ``visualize.py`` transforms the genetic networkx graph generated from ``macrogenesis.py`` into a PyGraphviz
  AGraph object for visualization
