########################

These utilities analyse and process the macrogenetic data XML files in the macrogenesis/ directory.

Usage
=====

Configure the output directory by setting the xml.dir and macrogenesis.macrogenesis-out properties in
``faust.ini`` or ``local.ini``.
Then you can run ``python macrogenesis.py``. The ``--watch`` option keeps the script running and re-runs the
analysis and rendering process whenever the source files change.

Directory Contents
==================

- ``dot-combine.sh`` is a shell script used to process Graphviz .dot files. It was called from the Java webapp
  but is probably obsolete and can be removed (TODO check)
- ``genetic_data_transcripts.py``
- ``graph.py`` parses the macrogenesis XML files into a networkx graph
- ``inscription_order.py`` calculates a heuristic absolute temporal ordering of all inscriptions
- ``macrogenesis.py`` is the main script to initiate the processing of macrogenetic data
- ``visualize.py`` transforms the genetic networkx graph generated from ``macrogenesis.py`` into a PyGraphviz
