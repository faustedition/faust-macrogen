## Bundled generated data

The data in this directory is generated by other components of the faustedition build. When building the macrogenesis data as part of the build, the data is automatically taken from the build. For standalone usage, we have included the data files in this directory.

To update the data from an actual docker build, run `./extract-from-build.sh /path/to/faust-gen-docker` in this directory.
